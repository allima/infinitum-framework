= Introduction =

The `Entity` annotation is used to indicate the persistence state of a model class. The annotation can be omitted and a model class will be persistent by default, but if properties need to be explicitly defined, then it should be applied.

= Annotation Attributes =

`Entity` has a number of attributes which are used to specify various entity properties.

*mode:* indicates the entity's persistence mode, persistent or transient. By default, this attribute is set to persistent.

*cascade:* indicates if the entity has cascading enabled. If it is, when its state is changed in the database, any entities related to it will also be updated.
