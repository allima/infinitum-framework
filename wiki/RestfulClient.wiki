= Introduction =

`RestfulClient` is an interface which provides facilities to communicate with RESTful web services. `RestfulClient` differs from RestfulModelClient in that it must be provided with RESTful endpoint URIs and request data, whereas the latter abstracts this information out so that a web service can be consumed using domain objects, almost like a RESTful ORM. While `RestfulModelClient` is geared towards communicating with a repository web service, `RestfulClient` is designed to simplify communication with _any_ RESTful service, external API or otherwise.

= Using a `RestfulClient` =

Infinitum provides an implementation of `RestfulClient` called `BasicRestfulClient`. Unlike `RestfulModelClient`, there is no configuration needed to use `RestfulClient` -- simply instantiate it and begin making web requests!

{{{
RestfulClient rest = new BasicRestfulClient();

// HTTP GET request
RestResponse = rest.executeGet("http://localhost/mywebservice/foo/42");

// HTTP DELETE request
RestResponse = rest.executeDelete("http://localhost/mywebservice/foo/42");

// HTTP POST request
String someJson = "{\"id\":\"328\",\"val\":\"42\"}";
RestResponse = rest.executePost("http://localhost/mywebservice/foo", someJson, "application/json");

// HTTP PUT request
String someJson = "{\"id\":\"328\",\"val\":\"76\"}";
RestResponse = rest.executePut("http://localhost/mywebservice/foo", someJson, "application/json");

}}}

We can also apply headers to our requests:

{{{
Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();
headers.put("Accept", "text/xml");
RestResponse = rest.executeGet("http://localhost/mywebservice/foo/42", headers);
}}}

Additionally, connection and response timeouts can be configured for the `RestfulClient`:

{{{
rest.setConnectionTimeout(5000);
rest.setResponseTimeout(5000);
}}}
