The Bean annotation is used to indicate that a class is a dependency-injection bean, meaning it is a candidate for auto-detection by the framework if classpath scanning is enabled.

The annotation has a single, optional attribute which indicates the name of the bean. If it is not specified, the bean takes the class name in camelcase form.

Beans that are picked up during auto-detection are registered with InfinitumContext and stored in its BeanFactory.
