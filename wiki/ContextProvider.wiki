= Introduction =

`ContextProvider` is used to configure Infinitum and to retrieve an instance of InfinitumContext. Before a context can be retrieved, `ContextProvider`'s `configure` method must be invoked by passing in a `Context` and a resource ID for InfinitumCfgXml. If a call is made to get an `InfinitumContext` before `configure` has been invoked, an `InfinitumConfigurationException` will be thrown.

`ContextProvider` may not be instantiated directly, but rather is accessed as a singleton by invoking its static method `getInstance()`.

= Acquiring an `InfinitumContext` =

The following code snippet illustrates how Infinitum is configured and how an instance of `InfinitumContext` is retrieved.

{{{
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
    InfinitumContext ctx = ContextProvider.getInstance().configure(this, R.xml.infinitum);
}
}}}
