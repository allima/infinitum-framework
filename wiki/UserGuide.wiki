== Introduction ==

Infinitum is a lightweight, extensible framework enabling Android developers to quickly and efficiently create rich, domain-driven applications while facilitating the convention-over-configuration paradigm. Infinitum's core components include an ORM and a RESTful web service client.

This user guide is designed to provide explanation for some of the various framework features and, perhaps more important, how to use them.

== Configuration ==

  * InfinitumCfgXml: XML framework configuration file
  * InfinitumContext: stores framework configuration data read from `infinitum.cfg.xml` and creates `Session`s.
  * InfinitumContextFactory: access point for retrieving `InfinitumContext` instances

== ORM ==

  * [Session]: Infinitum persistence service.
  * [Criteria]: object-oriented database queries.
